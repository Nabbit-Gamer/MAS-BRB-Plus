# MAS-BRB-Plus
A new option for saying you'll be right back, as well as some redone ones from base MAS. I might add some more later, I don't know.
To get the submod (and most submods) to work, you need to go into the files of MAS, go in the game folder, and put the download in a Submods folder.
If you don't have a submods folder then just create one.
